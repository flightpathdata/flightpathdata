# The power frontend for CsvPath Framework

Preboarding inbound tabular data before it lands in your data lake, applications, or analytics lowers risk and reduces frustration and costs. [CsvPath Framework](https://www.csvpath.org) is the leading data preboarding infrastructure and FlightPath is the way to turbo charge it.

FlightPath is open, free, and cross-platform. Find it on the [Apple MacOS Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flightpath-data/id6745823097?mt=12), the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P9PBPKZ4JDF), or on [GitHub](https://github.com/dk107dk/flightpath/tree/main).
